# RPi-Emulator

RPi-Emulator is a newly launched computer program, which is designed to facilitate the emulation of
Raspbian environment on Windows computer. This program is like a simplified model of QEMU with
similar setup but different user interface.

Raspberry Pi Emulator serves as a form of wrapper for QEMU, with the primary aim of simplifying
Raspberry Pi emulation, while also improving the overall operational efficiency of the simulated
hardware on your computer.

Typically, this Raspberry Pi emulator provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and also
expands system storage, to accomodate the Raspbian data.

Essentially, RPi-Emulator is a new program that allows you to easily run a Raspbian system on your
Windows computer, to emulate the Raspberry Pi 3 hardware and enjoy unrestrained coding experience on
your Windows PC.
